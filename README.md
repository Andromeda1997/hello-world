# hello-world

Hello!
I'm Andromeda.
I'm a student at my galaxy's top university. "Mintrailias Intergalactical School for the Exceptionally Gifted", or M.I.S.E.G for short.
I am currently learning about your planet, earth, and was interested in your prehistoric ways. 
I hope that as I learn I will become more aquainted with your cultures and will begin to understand the human race a little better.
